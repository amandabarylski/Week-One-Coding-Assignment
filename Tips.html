        <h2>When Near an Aether Well</h2>
        <p>Whether you recently moved near one or are traveling to a region with one, we know it's not always possible to avoid
            aether wells. If you are entering that field of study, you may actively seek them out. So, we've compiled a list
            of tips to help you stay safe while near these incredible phenomena.
        </p>
        <!--Since the order of items does not matter, I chose to use an unordered list.-->
        <ul>
            <li>Learn where the aether well's immediate radius lies and do your best to remain outside of it. Even researchers
                enter these areas as little as possible.
            </li>
            <li>Research what phenomena the aether well causes even outside of its immediate radius.</li>
            <li>Have someone nearby you can rely on if an incident occurs.</li>
            <li>Invest in warding devices. These can be found in most stores that sell other safety gear.</li>
            <li>Do not travel near an aether well that shares your original element as there is a risk of aether
                pull (see below).</li>
            <li>If you live near an aether well that shares your original element, relocate as soon as possible and seek
                immediate assistance if you begin to show symptoms of aether pull (see below).
            </li>
        </ul>

        <!--The second list, also unordered, only required a heading to introduce it.-->
        <h2>Symptoms of Aether Pull</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Vivid dreams or hallucinations related to magical abilities</li>
            <li>Loss of control of magical abilities</li>
            <li>Uncontrollable movements towards the location of the aether well</li>
        </ul>
        <!--I chose to use bolded text here for emphasis on an important message, and placed it below the list so that
        visitors to the site would look through the related list first.-->
        <p><b>If you or someone you know displays one or more of these symptoms, seek help immediately!</b></p>
