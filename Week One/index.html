    Create a homepage named index.html
    At least 3 pages with links to navigate between all pages present on each page.
    2 different size headers, a list, 3 images, a table, and a form.

    <!--To remain organized, I grouped the information into sections, each with its own header.-->
    <!--This first section is a brief paragraph to introduce users to the concept. To make it more legible to someone
    looking over the code, I have moved some of it to different lines as I have with my comments without putting line
    breaks in the code itself. This allows for the paragraph to remain cohesive in the live version without requiring
    side scrolling when looking at the code.-->

        <h2>What is an Aether Well?</h2>
        <p>Aether wells are concentrated sources of magic. They affect the areas around them in different ways according 
            to their attribute or element. While they are naturally occurring, their origin is still a point of 
            contention among scholars. Some believe they leak magical energy from another world into ours, others that 
            they are the source of ley lines and part of the natural cycle of magic returning to Arellea. Whatever the 
            case, they have long captured the imaginations of scholars and storytellers alike. However, it is important 
            to note that the magical phenomena around them are often dangerous. Whether you live in a region with an 
            aether well nearby or are traveling to one, it is best to take precautions and stay out of the immediate 
            radius, the size of which varies between aether wells.</p>

    height to proportionally correct.-->

        <h2>Well Artifacts</h2>
        <p>While the name "well artifact" may seem whimsical, these objects contain a link to the associated aether well
            that allows a bearer to draw on additional magical energy. They are made of a unique dark metal with an odd 
            luster, and do not reflect light normally. They are usually about palm-sized and come in various shapes 
            depending on the aether well they originate from. As an example, see the image below of the medallion from 
            the Doreinaiika Tree. If you find one, report it to your nearest research center immediately and do not utilize 
            it. Usage causes external aether poisoning and prolonged exposure may be deadly. However, separation from the 
            object will cause symptoms to decrease and eventually vanish.</p>

    <!--For the "Links" section, I renamed the index link "Top" as it would bring the user to the top of the page. I copied
    and pasted the section into the other two pages, renaming the links accordingly. I also added line breaks so that it
    would look cleaner.-->
