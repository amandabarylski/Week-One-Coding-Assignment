    <h1>What Makes Each Aether Well Unique?</h1>
    <!--I placed the table in the same section as the corresponding header and paragraph to keep it organized.-->
    <section>
        <h2>Elemental Affinity</h2>
        <p>Each aether well has a single element or affinity that determines its affect on the world and can assist us
            in determining what kind of phenomena to expect. While even aether wells of the same element will not be 
            identical, they will bear some similarities. For example, the Darksun and the Doreinaiika Tree share the 
            element of light and both have illumination and illusions in their area of influence. However, the Darksun's 
            illusions are more prominent, particularly in the records of the now sealed maze, while its more distant 
            influence allows plants to grow that otherwise would be unable to that deep underground. Meanwhile the 
            Doreinaiika Tree is just the opposite, with the glowing fruit and flowers only appearing close to it while 
            the wider area has a high number of ghost and alien sightings caused by a faint illusory affect. Below, we've 
            summarized what to expect from aether wells with different affinities, and given an example of each discovered 
            kind. Note that fire and healing have not been observed yet and are purely theoretical, though a few highly 
            dangerous areas are suspected of having a fire-aligned aether well.</p>

        <h2>"Pure" and "Corrupted" Aether Wells</h2>
        <p>Aether wells sometimes go through changes in the way they affect the world. These changes only happen when 
            mages draw from them. The original state of the aether well is usually referred to as "pure," while if a
            change happens the well is referred to as "corrupted." While slight alterations might occur in the behavior 
            of the phenomena, the changes are primarily visual. See a comparison below of the presentation of the "pure"
            and "corrupted" Heart of the Woods based on a description given by Dr. Altemintha Xalsh.</p>
        <!--I wanted the image to be closer to where it was referred to, so I placed it in the middle of the section in
        between two paragraphs.-->
        <img src="Images/Heart of the Woods.jpg" height="300" alt="An artist's depiction of the Heart of the Woods, with
        the image on the left in its rotting, brown state and the image on the right in its verdant, green state.">
        <p>Despite the change in appearance, with the Rot being much less pleasant to look at, the Verdance is no less 
            aggressive in spreading and in consuming anything that is not symbiotic with it. Most of the changes are 
            reported by those experiencing aether pull, with "corrupted" aether wells giving more disturbing visions. 
            However, while this is a consistent trend when comparing reports from those, experiencing aether pull, it is
            still subjective. Do not consider an aether well safe simply because it is "pure."</p>
